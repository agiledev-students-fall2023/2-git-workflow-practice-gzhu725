- I found this [article](https://sdtimes.com/ai/new-amazon-bedrock-preview-feature-allows-foundation-models-to-connect-to-company-data-sources/).
- This article announces a couple new features added onto Amazon Web Services, which is commonly used for databases. AWS has expanded its AI capabilities, allowing companies to connect their own data to foundation models. This implicates that businesses can leverage their proprietary data to enhance the performance and specificity of AI models.
- In addition, AWS aims to improve overall quality of AI responses. This can lead to more relevant and context-specific answers, which is crucial for things like chatbots, virtual assistants, which rely heavily on AI to deliver accurate answers. Using foundation models can result in more effective and personal AI interactions, ultimately enhancing user experience.

## Richards Comments

I wonder how Amazon plans on making it so that their AI is capable of being more accurate and how they will prevent people from recieivng misinformation.

##Christine's comments
I also have the same thoughts as Richard...Wish the article would tell us more about how Amazon is going to implement it and prevent hallucination from happening.
